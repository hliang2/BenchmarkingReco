We propose an **experimental framework** to measure algorithmic bias in face recognition using **synthetic face datasets** and **human perceptual annotations**.  
Unlike traditional observational benchmarks, our method manipulates attributes independently, enabling **causal conclusions** about bias.

## Key Highlights
- **Synthetic Dataset**  
  - 10,200 synthetic identities  
  - 48,000 face pairs  
  - Balanced across **race (White, Black, East Asian)** and **gender (Male, Female)**  
  - Controlled edits of **pose, age, expression, and lighting**  

- **Human Consensus Identity Confidence (HCIC)**  
  - 555,000+ human annotations for both single-attribute labels and pairwise identity similarity  
  - Provides perceptual ground truth for benchmarking algorithms  

- **Findings**  
  - Popular face recognition models (SphereFace, ArcFace variants) show **lower accuracy for Black and East Asian subgroups** compared to White groups.  
  - Recognition performance is most sensitive to **pose** and **expression**, less so to lighting and age.
